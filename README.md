### 💻 Software Engineer | Cyber Enthusiast | Life-Long Learner  

Currently, work as a **Software Engineer at Capital One**, my primary focus is on content delivery along with mitigating against large-scale botnet attacks.
I'm passionate about **cloud security**, **automation**, and learning how I can build systems that scale and are cyber resilient.

A little about my background, I am a **George Mason University alum** with a **B.S. in Cyber Security Engineering**. Some hobbies of mine are trying new foods, exploring local gems, along with hanging with friends and family.
